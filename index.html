                <p>GAME RULES: <br>
                    - The game has 2 players, playing in rounds;<br>
                    - In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he whishes. Each result get added to his
                    ROUND score;<br>
                    - BUT, if the player rolls a 1, all his ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's
                    turn;<br>
                    - The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLBAL score.
                    After that, it's the next player's turn;<br>
                    - The first player to reach 100 points on GLOBAL score wins the game, unless you change it in the
                    "Final score" field.<br> <br>

                    TIP: <br>
                    - You can change the player name by clicking on each player.
